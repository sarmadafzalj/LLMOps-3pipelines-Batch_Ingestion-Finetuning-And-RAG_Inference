context: In software, a commonly expressed sentiment is the idea that enterprises should just buy from Microsoft, from whom they can purchase every single software product they'll ever need in a seamless, vertically integrated platform, and be done with it. There's no need to juggle 10 different software and cloud computing vendors: Just buy from one (MSFT) and be done. This sentiment is what continues to drive Microsoft's inconceivably large scale and recently announced exceptional growth rate.
